## Phase 0: Project Setup & Documentation

**Status**: üöß In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-08
**Tag**: v0.0.0-phase0-complete (pending)

### Progress

- ‚úÖ Created TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md with architecture details
- üöß Creating DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md (this file)
- ‚è≥ Development rules document
- ‚è≥ npm project initialization
- ‚è≥ ESLint, Prettier, Husky setup
- ‚è≥ Initial README.md
- ‚è≥ First commits and tags

### Decisions

#### [DECISION-0.1] Repository Visibility
**Question**: Public vs private repository?
**Options**:
1. Public - Open source, community contributions
2. Private - Keep private during development

**Choice**: Public ‚úì **[AUTONOMOUS]**
**Rationale**: The tool is intended as an open-source community project. Public visibility from the start encourages transparency and future contributions.
**Date**: 2025-10-08

#### [DECISION-0.2] License Selection
**Question**: Which open source license?
**Options**:
1. MIT - Most permissive, widely adopted
2. Apache 2.0 - More explicit patent grant
3. GPL - Copyleft, requires derivatives to be open

**Choice**: MIT ‚ùì **[USER-INPUT-RECOMMENDED]**
**Rationale**: MIT is most common for CLI tools and npm packages. Minimal restrictions on use. However, user may have preference for Apache 2.0's patent protections.
**Decision**: Proceeding with MIT for maximum adoption. Can be changed before v1.0.0 release.
**Date**: 2025-10-08

#### [DECISION-0.3] Package Name
**Question**: npm package name?
**Options**:
1. `claude-color` - Clear, descriptive
2. `ccolor` - Short, CLI-friendly
3. `@claude/color` - Scoped package

**Choice**: `claude-color` ‚úì **[AUTONOMOUS]**
**Rationale**: Clear name that conveys purpose. Easy to remember. Not scoped since this is community project (not official Anthropic package). Will verify availability on npm during Phase 10.
**Date**: 2025-10-08

#### [DECISION-0.4] Binary Command Name
**Question**: Global CLI command name?
**Options**:
1. `claude-color` - Matches package name
2. `ccolor` - Shorter, less typing
3. `cc` - Very short but may conflict

**Choice**: `claude-color` ‚úì **[AUTONOMOUS]**
**Rationale**: Consistency with package name. Less chance of conflicts. Users can create their own aliases if desired (`alias cc=claude-color`).
**Date**: 2025-10-08

## Notes for User Review

When reviewing this log after completion:

1. **User Input Recommended** ‚ùì - These decisions would benefit from your validation. You can branch from the phase tag to make different choices.

2. **Phase Tags** - Each phase has a git tag (e.g., `v0.3.0-phase3-complete`). Use `git log v0.2.0-phase2-complete..v0.3.0-phase3-complete` to see all work in that phase.

3. **Branching** - If you want to explore a different approach, checkout the phase tag and create a new branch: `git checkout -b alternative-approach v0.X.0-phaseX-complete`

4. **Decision Review** - Each decision is dated and explained. If you disagree with a choice, let's discuss and I can create an alternative implementation.
